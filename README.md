# Chip-8 Emulator

A Chip-8 emulator built in C++ with SDL2 graphics and audio support.

> **Note to Participants:** 
> This codebase is intentionally incomplete and contains implementation defects across opcode handling, memory management, timing control, and rendering pipeline. Please consult the **Problem Statement** document for your exact submission guidelines and evaluation criteria.

## Features

- All 35 Chip-8 opcodes implemented
- 64x32 pixel display with SDL2 rendering
- Keyboard input support
- Sound effects (beep tone)
- 60 FPS rendering

## Architecture

Chip-8 is a virtual machine from the 1970s designed to make programming video games easier on early microcomputers.

### System Specifications

- **Memory**: 4 KB (4096 bytes)
  - `0x000-0x1FF`: Reserved for interpreter and fonts
  - `0x200-0xFFF`: Program/ROM space
- **Registers**:
  - 16 8-bit general-purpose registers (V0-VF)
  - VF doubles as a flag register for arithmetic operations
  - 16-bit index register (I)
  - 16-bit program counter (PC)
  - 8-bit stack pointer (SP)
- **Display**: 64x32 pixels, monochrome
- **Timers**: 
  - Delay timer (counts down at 60 Hz)
  - Sound timer (beeps when > 0, counts down at 60 Hz)
- **Stack**: 16 levels for subroutine calls
- **Keypad**: 16-key hexadecimal input

## Dependencies

- SDL2 library

### Installation

**Arch Linux:**
```bash
sudo pacman -S sdl2
```

**Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev
```

**macOS:**
```bash
brew install sdl2
```

## Building

1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TatHack-Tathva/chip8-emulator.git
```

2. Make it
```bash
make
```

## Usage
```bash
./chip8 <path-to-rom-file>
```

**Example:**
```bash
./chip8 roms/PONG.ch8
```

## Keyboard Mapping

The original Chip-8 keypad is mapped to keyboard keys:
```
Chip-8 Keypad:          QWERTY Keyboard:
┌─┬─┬─┬─┐               ┌─┬─┬─┬─┐
│1│2│3│C│               │1│2│3│4│
├─┼─┼─┼─┤               ├─┼─┼─┼─┤
│4│5│6│D│               │Q│W│E│R│
├─┼─┼─┼─┤      =        ├─┼─┼─┼─┤
│7│8│9│E│               │A│S│D│F│
├─┼─┼─┼─┤               ├─┼─┼─┼─┤
│A│0│B│F│               │Z│X│C│V│
└─┴─┴─┴─┘               └─┴─┴─┴─┘
```

**Controls:**
- `ESC` - Quit emulator
- Keyboard keys as mapped above

### Game-Specific Controls

**PONG:**
- Left paddle: `1` (up), `Q` (down)
- Right paddle: `4` (up), `R` (down)

**TETRIS:**
- `Q` - Rotate
- `W` - Drop
- `E` - Move right
- `A` - Move left

## Implementation Details

### Instruction Set

The emulator implements all 35 Chip-8 instructions, including:
- **Arithmetic**: ADD, SUB, AND, OR, XOR, shift operations
- **Graphics**: Draw sprites with XOR mode, collision detection
- **Flow control**: Jump, call/return subroutines, conditional skips
- **Memory**: Load/store registers, BCD conversion
- **Timers**: Delay and sound timer operations
- **Input**: Key press detection (blocking and non-blocking)

### Display

Graphics are rendered using SDL2:
- Each Chip-8 pixel is scaled 10× for visibility (640×320 window)
- XOR-based sprite drawing for collision detection
- 60 FPS rendering

### Audio

Simple square wave generation at 440 Hz (musical note A) plays when `sound_timer > 0`.

# ---------BUGS CORRCETED AND ADDED FEATURES--------
Development Approach

This project was developed by first understanding the overall CHIP-8 architecture and the responsibilities of each component, followed by implementing, testing, and debugging the emulator incrementally.

During development, external references and tools were used to clarify unfamiliar concepts and understand the expected behavior of the CHIP-8 system. The implementation was then reviewed and corrected based on the CHIP-8 specification and our understanding of the underlying architecture.

Particular attention was given to:

Opcode decoding and execution

Memory and register management

Stack and program-counter behavior

Timer synchronization

Sprite rendering and collision detection

Keyboard input handling

SDL2 rendering and audio

CPU and display timing

Rather than relying solely on existing implementations, we verified the behavior of each component through debugging and testing, and made the necessary corrections to ensure the emulator follows the expected CHIP-8 behavior.

AI Usage:
      1. To understand what is chip-8 
      2. To Understand the architecture implementation of Chip-8 
      3. To understand chip-8 emulator code
      4. AI-assisted hints were used to identify potential bugs, which were then understood, verified, and corrected through our own analysis of the CHIP-8 architecture and behavior.
